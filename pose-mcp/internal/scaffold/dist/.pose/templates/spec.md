# Spec: <feature-slug>

> Single POSE spec template. Fill the relevant sections; remove the ones that
> don't apply. Keep the order: Intent → Requirements → Technical Plan →
> Tasks → Decisions → Validation → Final Report.
>
> **Lifecycle:** update `status` as you go (`draft` → `in-progress` → `done`).
> On completion, run the closeout flow (skill `pose-spec-closeout`): set
> `status: done`, fill `completed_at` and disposition every follow-up.

## 1. Intent

### Goal
<!-- What this feature delivers, in one sentence. -->

### Business value
<!-- Why it is worth doing now. -->

### Constraints
<!-- Technical limits, deadlines, compliance. -->

### Non-goals
<!-- What is explicitly out of scope. -->

---

## 2. Requirements

> Definition of Ready (entry gate): before `status: in-progress`, functional
> requirements must have **acceptance criteria with stable IDs** (`- R<N>: ...`).
> Published IDs are never renumbered; a removed criterion is marked as
> withdrawn. Verify with `pose lint-spec <slug> --ready-check`.
>
> Optional EARS form: `- R1: When <trigger>, the <system> shall <behavior>.`
> Verify an opted-in spec with `pose lint-spec <slug> --ears`.

### Follow-ups

<!--
Every follow-up starts with a bracketed disposition. When the spec is marked
`status: done`, every follow-up MUST have one (use `[open]` for the untriaged
ones — `pose followups --open` aggregates them).

Valid dispositions:
  [open]                  not yet triaged (live backlog)
  [spawned: <slug>]       became/seeded a new spec
  [covered: <slug>]       already covered by another existing spec
  [duplicate: <slug>]     same follow-up already triaged in another spec
  [done]                  resolved directly, without a separate spec
  [wont-do: <reason>]     consciously discarded
-->

- [open]
